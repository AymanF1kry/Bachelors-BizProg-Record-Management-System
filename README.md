# üìö MPH Record Management System - Business Programming Project

This project is on a developed system named **MPH Record Management System** that I made during my Bachelor's degree in one of the subjects called **Business Programming**. It is an individual project and serves as the final project for the subject. The system is built using **Python**, and I used **Visual Studio Code** as the development software, though users are free to choose any software that supports Python.

This record-keeping system is mainly intended for the use of MPH staff to manage crucial records consisting of customer purchase records and book records. The records are stored in a **JSON file** which acts as a modern DBMS. The main goal of the system is to streamline the integration of inventory records and purchasing records while also handling day-to-day business activities. It is a **command-line system** filled with proper validations and a login authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features and Functionalities

1. The system allows users to:
   - Insert appropriate records into designated secure file locations.
   - Search specific data records for identification purposes.
   - Update existing records with newly defined information.
   - Delete redundant and unnecessary data records.
   - Display records in a structured, tabulated format.
   - Generate and export particular records into other files.

2. Incorporates a **login authentication system** for added security. Users must log in using valid credentials, or the system will prompt an error message.

3. Ensures data **security**, **availability**, and **integrity** by segregating data records into suitable storage files.

4. Can generate report outputs from existing data, useful for future **business intelligence** and **analytics** initiatives.

5. Prevents data entry errors by implementing extensive **input validation** for each function.
